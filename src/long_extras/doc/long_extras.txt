mp_limb_signed_t z_randtest(flint_rand_t state)

    Returns a pseudo random number with a random number of bits, from 
    $0$ to \code{FLINT_BITS}.  The probability of the special values $0$, 
    $\pm 1$, \code{COEFF_MAX}, \code{COEFF_MIN}, \code{LONG_MAX} and 
    \code{LONG_MIN} is increased.

    This random function is mainly used for testing purposes.

mp_limb_signed_t z_randtest_not_zero(flint_rand_t state)

    As for \code{z_randtest(state)}, but does not return $0$.
